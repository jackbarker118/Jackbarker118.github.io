Introduction I have chosen to explore two datasets containing information on comic book cahracters, specifically Marvel and DC comic characters. I started to think of datasets that could be compatible and Marvel and DC immediately came to mind. I&#39;ve been a fan of marvel and have had several arguments with friends on which universe is more powerful. Now I can actually find out for myself. I found datasets on forum in kaggle a site were people post their projects for public veiwing and use.</description>

      <description>Intoduction I have decided to use my joined dataset of Marvel and DC Comic characters from the last project. The main variables i want focus on in this project are the alignment of the characters(whether they are are good, bad or neutral) publisher (Marvel or DC) and their performance stats; intelligence, strength, speed, durabilty, power, and combat. the perfomance stats are weighted stats ou tof 100 for each character. There are 503 characters in the dataset and i will see if there are any connection btween these stats and their alignment and or publisher.</description>
