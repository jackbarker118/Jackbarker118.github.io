## In python we were able to create a function that can scan dna stands to find how many times each three ltter base code shows up in the sequence and tell you

```{python}
import re
my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"

# Your code goes here
def count_mers(my_seq1):
    mers=re.findall(r'[ATGC][ATGC][ATGC]',my_seq1)
    counts={}
    for c in mers:
        if c in counts:
            counts[c]+=1
        else:
            counts[c]=1
    for c in counts:
        print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")
count_mers(my_seq1)
count_mers(my_seq2)
```
